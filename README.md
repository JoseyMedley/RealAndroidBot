# RealAndroidBot

[![RAB Video Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wtpJ9_av-qc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtpJ9_av-qc)

## Notes
This is a deobfuscated version of the original RealAndroidBot.
The original was packed with SOURCEDEFENDER.
I used [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) to put breakpoints into python310.dll 
and grabbed the cleartext source from the stack.
It runs faster than the original and you are able to modify it easily.
